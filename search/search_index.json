Creating RSS feeds from PubMed","text":"<p>RSS standards for \"Really Simple Syndication\" and is a service that allows you to subscribe to feeds and be alerted when an update is published.</p> <p>A really prevalent use of RSS feeds these days is Podcasts. In a podcasting app, the app can keep track of which episodes you've listened to, and show you a list of previous episodes. It also knows to mark as \"unlistened\" new episodes that come out while you're subscribed to the feed.</p> <p>In the same way, when you first subscribe to an RSS feed, everything will be \"unread\", and on subsequent loads, only new articles will be marked as unread... so don't be overwhelmed.</p> <p>Many academic journals publish an RSS feed, but I've found them to be a bit unreliable and inconsistent. I recently learnt that you can use PubMed to generate RSS feeds from search results.</p> <p> You can see that when selecting the category to Journal, PubMed recommends the journal title. </p> <p></p> <p> This shows the search results, for all PubMed entries from the Red Journal. Immediately under the search box, the \"Create RSS\" link is what you want.</p> <p> You can rename the RSS feed, and select the number of items displayed (I chose 100). Once you click the Create RSS button, PubMed will generate a URL for you to paste into your RSS reader.</p> <p> Here I created a search team that was a combination of the Lancet journal, and the MeSH Major Topic \"cancer\". You can generate an RSS feed from ANY search this way.</p> <p>I did this for The Lancet and for NEJM, as the major papers are published in these larger banner journals.</p>"},{"location":"literature/#2-subscribing-to-the-feeds-on-an-rss-reader","title":"2.
